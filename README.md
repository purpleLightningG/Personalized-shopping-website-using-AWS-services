Personalized shopping website using AWS services

This repository contains the jupyter notebook of the personalization of a shopping website, runnning each of the instances of the notebook makes the website personalized - it means that when a particular user using their account will buy some products, the user data will be used to make shopping of the user easier by recommending similar and related products the next time.

The video explains each of the steps in making the website personalized, the real website link is not given as it was obtained by using aws account that was active for 24 hours only. After that it expired, but the workings have been recorded and attatched here.

Note:
 This notebook is only for the search option personalization in the UI
 Due to several size compressions of the video file (due to the 25mb restriction) the quality has slightly decrased
